This directory contains modified versions (some of which are still WIP) of Josh Tingey's analysis scripts. The originals can be found in Bristol-SiD-Development/pixelStudies. These versions have been changed for compatibility with DD4Hep, with small additions for debugging.

There are also alternative analysis scripts (tracking_histograms.py, dependent on extracttrack.py and histwrap.py) available.
